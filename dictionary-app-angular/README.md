# 📖 Angular Dictionary App

This is a simple dictionary app built using **Angular**, a framework I have recently taught myself. The app allows users to search for a word, and if the word exists in the dictionary, it will display its definition. If the word is not found, a "Word not found" message will be shown.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Search Functionality**: Enter a word in the search bar and get its definition.
- 📖 **Predefined Dictionary**: The app retrieves definitions from a JSON file stored in the root of the app.
- 🎨 **Styled with CSS**: A clean and minimal UI for a smooth user experience.
- ⚡ **Built with TypeScript**: Ensuring a strongly typed and scalable application.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Angular** (Self-taught framework)
- **TypeScript**
- **CSS** for styling
- **JSON** for word definitions

## 👩🏻‍💻 How to Run the App

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dictionary-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash

   ```

3. Install dependencies:
